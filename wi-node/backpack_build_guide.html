      <p><strong>Building a Wi-Node Backpack - in Words and Pictures</strong></p>

      <p>
        Guide created and maintained by: <a href="http://www.ichilton.co.uk" target="_blank">Ian Chilton</a> - please direct any suggestions or corrections to: ian [at] ichilton [dot] co [dot] uk.<br />

        If you get stuck, there is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanode-users" target="_blank">Nanode Mailing List</a> and an IRC channe

      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h3>

      <p>
        The Wi-Node can be used in two modes - either as a shield (or backpack) for an existing Arduino/Nanode or as a standalone node.<br />
        <br />
        It's the backpack we are building here - to build the Wi-Node as a <a href="build_guide.html">standalone node</a>, refer to the <a href="build_guide.html">separate build guide</a>.
        <br />
        If you are not familar with the Nanode, see <a href="http://www.ichilton.co.uk/blog/electronics/nanode-a-low-cost-internet-connected-arduino-board-458.html" target="_blank">my blog post introducing the Nanode</a> and <a href="http://www.ichilton.co.uk/blog/electronics/introducing-the-nanode-rf-and-wi-node-471.html" taget="_blank">my blog post introducing the Nanode RF & Wi-Node</a>.<br />
        <br />
        To sumarise, the Wi-Node is an Arduino compatible board with RFM12B wireless, SRAM, Micro-SD card and a motor driver.<br />
        <br />
        I am maintaining a <a href="http://ichilton.github.com/nanode" target="_blank">a page of useful Nanode links</a> which are worth keeping an eye on as there is information like pin usage and pointers to useful code and libraries.<br />
        <br />
        Some other useful information:

        You can view an <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/113068889724287585425/WiNodeBuild" target="_blank">album with all of the photos here</a> - they will be labelled with which step they relate to. You can click on each of the images below to view it on Picasa and view a bigger version or zoom in.<br />
        <br />
        Building a Wi-Node Backpack is just a case of replicating the steps shown in the following picture sequence - no real electronics experience needed - just basic soldering skills.<br />
        <br />
        The pcb is built in an orderly sequence starting with the resistors and small components that are low on the board and then working up to the bulkier parts like connectors. After soldering each component, you need to cut off the excess lead from the bottom using some cutters.<br />
        <br />
        It is very easy to cause shorts which will make the board or specific parts of it not work. What i'd advise is that you take your time during the build, be precise, use minimal solder and carefully check each joint after soldering it. If you suspect any short, check it with a multimeter and fix any shorts there and then, before continuing.<br />
        <br />
        Even if you have been soldering for years, i'd highly recommend these videos to get the right tools and improve your technique:<br />

        It's recommended you read through the whole of this guide and familiarise yourself with the steps before you start the actual build.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>We're still waiting for components to be able to do this guide - this is just a placeholder for now.</strong></p>

      <p>In the meantime, here are some very rough notes on how to build a Wi-Node Backpack. Real build guide to follow soon.</p>

      <pre>
1.  Solder the RFM12 module in place first
2.  Solder the 10K resistor network (6 pins marked 103) into position marked 4K7 (yes - an error in the screenprint). The spot on the res network goes closest to the RFM12 module.
3. Add the 3V3 regulator and the 10uF electrolytic and the blue 100nF immediately behind the 3V3 regulator.
4. Fit the reset switch.
5. Fit the 100R resistor on the RHS of the pcb - close to the 7805 reg footprint.
6. Fit the LED - with the long anode lead closest to the top edge of the pcb.
7.  Solder the 5 off 4K7 resistors into the 10 way SIL footprint  next to the shield connectors.  These resistors along with the 10K network  divide the 5V SPI signals  from the Nanode 5/Arduino down to 3V3 for the RFM12.
8  Finally break the SIL pin-strip into 2 x 8 and 2 x 6. Push these into th shiled connectors of an Arduino/Nanode 5 and use this as a jig to solder to the W10 pcb.

That completes the minimum build. You should have the following fitted
RFM12
1 x 10K  SIL network 5 resistors commoned
3V3 regulator
1 x 100nF ceramic capacitor (blue)
1 x 10uF electrolytic capacitor
1 x 100R resistor
1 x green LED
5 x 4K7 resistor
reset switch
2 x 8 pin long pin headers
2 x 6 pin long pin headers
82mm (cut length) aerial

OK the W10 kits include extra parts that allow you to build the options onto the pcb. These options are:

1. 32K x 8 SRAM
2. MCP79410 Real Time Clock
3. Motor Driver IC  L293D equivalent
